description: "Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, also published as Mrs Beeton's\
  \ Cookery Book, is an extensive guide to running a household in Victorian Britain,\
  \ edited by Isabella Beeton and first published as a book in 1861. It had previously\
  \ been published in parts. It was originally entitled Beeton's Book of Household\
  \ Management, as one of the series of guide-books published by her husband, Samuel\
  \ Beeton. The recipes were highly structured, in contrast to earlier cookbooks.\
  \ It was illustrated with many monochrome and colour plates.\nAlthough Mrs Beeton\
  \ died in 1865, the book continued to be a best-seller. The first editions after\
  \ her death contained an obituary notice, but this was removed from later editions,\
  \ allowing readers to imagine that every word was written by an experienced Mrs\
  \ Beeton personally. This fiction was expressed in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's novels,\
  \ where a character declares: \"Mrs Beeton must have been the finest housekeeper\
  \ in the world, therefore Mr. Beeton must have been the happiest and most comfortable\
  \ man\".\nMany of the recipes were copied from the most successful cookery books\
  \ of the day including Eliza Acton's Modern Cookery for Private Families, Elizabeth\
  \ Raffald's The Experienced English Housekeeper, Marie-Antoine Carême's Le Pâtissier\
  \ royal parisien, Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy, Maria\
  \ Eliza Rundell's A New System of Domestic Cookery, and the works of Charles Elmé\
  \ Francatelli. This practice of Mrs Beeton's has in modern times repeatedly been\
  \ described as plagiarism.\nThe book expanded steadily in length, until by 1907\
  \ it reached 74 chapters and over 2000 pages. Nearly two million copies were sold\
  \ by 1868, and it remains in print (as of 2016). Between 1875 and 1914 it was probably\
  \ the most often consulted cookery book. Mrs Beeton has been compared on the strength\
  \ of the book with modern domestic goddesses like Nigella Lawson and Delia Smith.\n\
